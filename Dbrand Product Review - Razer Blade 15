# Dbrand Product Review - Carbon Fiber Skin for Razer Blade 15 (2019, AE, RTX Graphics) 

The Carbon Fiber skin from Dbrand for the Razer Blade 15 is of exceptional quality. Whether one thinks about the actual carbon fiber like feel of the product, or the actual appearance, it is undeniably beautiful! It also makes it so the laptop is easier to hold during transporation, and helps to prevent scratching and other blemishes from being visible, or at least, from being caused at all. It also allows your already premium laptop to feel just that little more premium and personalized to your tastes.

Overall... I absolutely suggest purchasing this product if yuou were looking to hide damage on your laptop, or even just personalize the appearance to your tastes! 

# Edit: This review was intended to target owners of the Razer Blade 15 laptop, though, Dbrand sells phone skins, laptop skins, and skins for a lot of other products! So don't feel limited in your options! 

# Super cool Review!
